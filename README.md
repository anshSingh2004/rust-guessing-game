## Features

- SQLite database integration with proper connection management
- Comprehensive error handling using Rust's Result type
- Clean, modular project structure following Rust best practices
- Documentation with examples and usage patterns
- Minimal and maintainable dependency set

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Cargo package manager (included with Rust)
- SQLite development libraries
- Basic knowledge of Rust and SQL

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd rust-sqlite-template
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Project Configuration

### Dependencies
The project uses `Cargo.toml` for dependency management. Key dependencies include:

- SQLite-related crates for database operations
- Error handling and utility libraries
- Core Rust standard libraries

### Database Configuration
- Database connections are managed safely with proper resource cleanup
- Connection parameters can be configured in the application code
- Support for both file-based and in-memory databases

## Development

### Main Components
- `src/main.rs`: Contains the core application logic and database operations
- Error handling patterns for robust database interactions
- Modular design for easy extension and modification

### Best Practices
- Follow Rust's ownership and borrowing rules
- Implement proper error handling using Result types
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Ensure proper resource management

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cargo test
```
